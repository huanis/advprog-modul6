### COMMIT 1: handle-connection, check response
The `handle_connection` function wraps the input stream with a buffer reader. It then reads the stream per line (separated by newlines) through the reader. Then, the value from the line is extracted. Only non-empty lines will be collected. They are referred by the `http_request` variable. Then, the function will print what is referred by `http_request` variable.
